\usage{get_graph(clust_irr, custom_db = NULL, edit_dist = 0)}
\arguments{
\item{clust_irr}{S4 object generated by the function \code{cluster_irr}}
\item{custom_db}{data.frame, custom database mapping CDR3 sequences to their
cognate antigens. The structure of \code{custom_db} must be identical to 
e.g. data(vdjdb). This is an optional input that allows us to annotate the 
CDR3s in our data. If \code{custom_db} is not provided, ClustIRR will use 
the internal databases. Else, ClustIRR will use both the internal and user-
provided databases.}
\item{edit_dist}{integer, edit distance threshold. CDR3 sequences from the
graph will be matched with CDR3 sequences with known antigenic specificities 
(from a database). If their edit distance is lower or equal to \code{edit_dist},
then we have a match. Default \code{edit_dist} = 0, i.e. only identical CDR3s 
are matched.}
}
\value{
The main output is a list. The list contains an \code{igraph} object. The graph 
vertices and edges contain attributes. Furthermore, it contains a data.frame 
in which rows are clones (vertices) in the graph. Finally, the list contains 
the logical variable \code{joint_graph}, which is set to \code{TRUE} if the 
graph is a joint graph generated by the function \code{get_joint_graph} and 
\code{FALSE} if the graph is not a joint graph generated by \code{get_graph}.

\description{
As input we take a \code{clust_irr} object generated by the function 
\code{cluster_irr}.

From the \code{clust_irr} object we generate a graph in which the vertices 
represent clones, and undirected edges are drawn between a pair of vertices if 
the corresponding clones are locally and/or globally similar (see clustering 
in the documentation of \code{cluster_irr}. 

The main output is an \code{igraph} object.

Furthermore, we compare CDR3s from the graph against CDR3 sequences with known 
epitopes from these databases: VDJdb, McPAS-TCR and TCR3d. The comparison
is done based on the edit distance, where the parameter \code{edit_dist} 
controls the edit distance threshold (default=0). If the edit distance 
between two CDR3s is smaller than \code{edit_dist}, then the database 
information related to this CDR3 is transfered as vertex attribute to the 
corresponding vertex.

With the parameter \code{custom_db}, the user can provide additional 
databases with CDR3 sequences and their cognate antigens.
