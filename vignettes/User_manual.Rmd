# Introduction
Adaptive immunity relies on diverse immune receptor repertoires (IRRs: B- and 
T-cell receptor repertoires) to protect the host against genetically diverse 
and rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancers. The 
sequence diversity of B- and T-cell receptors (BCRs and TCRs) originates, in 
part, from V(D)J recombination, a process in which different germline-encoded 
genes are joined to form unique immune receptors. As a result, practically 
every newly formed naive mature T and B cell is equipped with a distinct 
immune receptor (IR), enabling them to recognize unique sets of antigens.

B cells bind antigens directly through the complementarity-determining regions 
(CDRs) of their BCRs, while T cells recognize antigenic peptides presented by 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules via the CDRs of their TCRs. 
Antigen recognition can lead to B/T cell activation, causing these cells to 
rapidly proliferate and form antigen-specific clones capable of mounting an 
effective immune response.

Recent studies have shown that sequence similarity between TCRs often 
indicates shared antigen specificity. Therefore, by clustering TCR sequences 
from high-throughput sequencing (HT-seq) data, we can identify groups of 
TCRs with shared antigen specificity. This information is crucial for the 
development of cancer immunotherapies, vaccines, and antiviral drugs.

This vignette introduces `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`, a computational method 
for clustering IRRs.

# Installation
`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` is freely available as part of Bioconductor, filling
the gap that currently exists in terms of software for quantitative analysis 
of IRRs. 

To install `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` please start R and enter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("ClustIRR")
```

# ClustIRR algorithm
The algorithm of `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` performs clustering of IRR sequences 
to find groups of receptors with similar specificity. 

```{r graphic, echo = FALSE, fig.align="left", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/extdata/logo.png")
```

## Input

The main input of `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` are two repertoires: `s` and `r`:

* `s`: IRR under investigation (case/sample)
* `r`: reference IRR (control/reference)

Both repertoires should be provided as data.frames. The rows in the 
data.frames correspond to clones (group of cells derived from a common 
parent cell by clonal expansion). `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` takes as input 
the **CDR3 amino acid  sequence** and the **size** of each clone.

**CDR3 sequences**

For each clone, `s` and `r`, must contain the amino acid sequences of the 
corresponding complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3s). We may have 
the CDR3s from one T cell receptor chain (e.g., only CDR3$\alpha$s or 
only CDR3$\beta$s) or from both chains (CDR3$\alpha\beta$). Similarly, we 
may have CDR3s from $\gamma\delta$ T-cells (CDR3$\gamma$ and CDR3$\delta$) 
or B-cells (CDR3H and CDR3L). This is explained in case study 4.
  
**clone size** 

`s` and `r` may also contain the size of each clone. This is provided by the 
column `clone_size`. If the clone sizes are not available, then we assume that
`clone_size` = 1.
  
Let's have a look at an example data set which we will use as input:

```{r}
data("CDR3ab", package = "ClustIRR")
```

```{r}
# take the first 500 CDR3b sequences from the data -> s
s <- data.frame(CDR3b = c(CDR3ab$CDR3b[1:500], "CASSSSPGDQEQFF"),
                clone_size = 1)

# take 5000 CDR3b sequences 501:5500 from the data -> r
r <- data.frame(CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[501:5500],
                clone_size = 1)
```


```{r}
str(s)
```


```{r}
str(r)
```



## Clustering

`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` employs two clustering strategies:

* **local**: detects enrichment of motifs in `s` compared to `r`
* **global**: identifies pairs of CDR3s in `s` that have similar sequences

The rationale behind these two clustering strategies is the following: two 
identical CDR3 sequences have the same specificity. Similar CDR3 sequences 
(e.g., CDR3 sequences that differ by only one amino acid) may have similar 
specificity. Global clustering is meant to find pairs of CDR3s that are
globally (based on the complete CDR3 sequences) similar. 

We also know that two CDR3s with significantly different sequences may still 
recognize the same peptide[^1] if they share a motif in their core regions 
(e.g., identical 4-mer). Such "useful" motifs may be enriched in `s`  but not 
in `r`, and local clustering aims to identify them.


### Local clustering

CDR3 sequences are segmented into overlapping **motifs** ($k$-mers), where $k$ 
is specified by setting the input $ks = 4$. 

Example of segmenting CDR3 sequence into 4-mers:

```{r}
cdr3 <- "CASSTTTGTGELFF"
ks <- 4
colnames(stringdist::qgrams(cdr3, q = ks))
```


Empirically we know that $k$-mers in the **core** of a CDR3 are more likely 
to establish contact with an antigenic peptide than $k$-mers in the flanks 
of the CDR3. Hence, the user is encouraged to remove a few amino acids from 
the flanks of each CDR3 sequence. This can be done by changing the control
input from `control$trim_flank_aa,` e.g.:
  
  * `control$trim_flank_aa = 0`: no trimming
  * `control$trim_flank_aa = 3`: trim three amino acids from both flanks 
  of the CDR3 sequence

Below we show an example of the procedure that trims CDR3 flanks and segments 
the core of the CDR3 sequence `CASSTTTGTGELFF` into 4-mers, the result of which 
are five overlapping motifs:

```{r}
t <- 3
cdr3_trimmed <- substr(x = cdr3, start = t + 1, stop = nchar(cdr3) - t)
colnames(stringdist::qgrams(cdr3_trimmed, q = ks))
```
 

A motif is considered enriched if the following (user-defined) criteria are 
satisfied:

1. `control$local_min_o`: minimum motif frequency in `s`
2. `control$local_min_ove`: minimum ratio of observed vs. expected (OvE) 
    relative motif frequency, with $OvE=\dfrac{f_s}{n_s}/\dfrac{f_r}{n_r}$
    * $f_{s}$ and $f_{r}$: motif frequencies in repertoires `s` and `r`
    * $n_{s}$ and $n_{r}$: total number of motifs in repertoires `s` and `r`
      
3. `control$local_max_fdr`: maximum false discovery rate (FDR). Corrected 
    p-value, computed by a one-sided Fisher's exact test (effectively a 
    hypergeometric test).


### Global clustering

For global clustering, `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` employs one of three strategies.
The user can select each strategy with the control parameters: `global_smart` 
and `global_pairs`

*Strategy 1:* if `control$global_smart = FALSE` (default)

Here, `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` quantifies the dissimilarity between pairs of 
CDR3 sequences using Hamming distances. Two CDR3 sequences with Hamming 
distance $\leq x$ are considered globally similar, where $x$ is the user-
defined threshold `control$global_max_hdist` (default = 1). 

With this, `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` provides a very simple and intuitive 
heuristic for identifying globally similar CDR3s. But, this approach also 
has drawbacks: 

1. CDR3 sequences with different lengths are by definition dissimilar
2. the Hamming distance, by design, ignores the properties of the amino acids

*Strategy 2:* if `control$global_smart = TRUE`

In this case, `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` does pairwise alignment of CDR3 sequences
and computes a BLOSUM62 score $B$ that is normalized by the alignment 
length $l$ $\rightarrow$ $NB = B/l$.

*Strategy 3:* if `control$global_pairs` is specified by the user

`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` also provides a second input option (see red input 
in `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` workflow), which allows the user to provide a 
data.frame containing globally similar CDR3 sequences computed by complementary
approaches (e.g., *tcrdist*). This input can be provided via the input 
parameter `control$global_pairs`. In this case, global clustering is not
performed by `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`.


## Output

The main function in `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` is `cluster_irr`. This function 
returns an S4 object of class `clust_irr`. The object contains two sublists 
(slots):

1. clustering results: tables and lists
2. processed inputs: processed form of the input data (`s`) and parameters

We will describe the inputs, outputs, and the algorithm of 
`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` with the help of the following case studies. 


# Case study 1: simple TCR repertoire analysis with `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`

In this example, we will insert the motif *LEAR* in the core regions of the 
first 20 CDR3b sequences of repertoire `s`. With this, we simulate enrichment 
of this motif. 

This motif is not enriched in repertoire `r`, and `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` 
should be able to detect *LEAR* as enriched:

```{r}
# insert motif LEAR
substr(x = s$CDR3b[1:20], start = 6, stop = 9) <- "LEAR"
```


... and then we perform clustering with `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`:

```{r}
o <- cluster_irr(s = s, r = r)
```


## Local clustering results
In the following table we see that `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` has detected 
enrichment of *LEAR* in `s` compared to `r`: 

```{r}
# extract local motifs
local_motifs <- get_clustirr_clust(o)$CDR3b$local$m

# display only passed motifs
knitr::kable(local_motifs[local_motifs$pass == TRUE, ], row.names = FALSE)
```

Interestingly, the motif *LLEA* is also enriched. This is probably because 
*LLEA* and *LEAR* share the substring *LEA*, hence, the enrichment of *LLEA* 
can be seen as a byproduct of the inserted motif *LEAR*.

This can also be seen from the lower frequency of *LLEA* ($f_s$ = 5) in `s` 
compared to *LEAR* ($f_s$ = 20). For *LEAR* we see FDR $\approx 10^{-15}$, 
which is significantly smaller than the FDR $\approx 10^{-2}$ observed for 
*LLEA*. Finally, for *LEAR* we see OvE $\approx 100$, whereas for *LLEA*'s  
OvE $=\infty$ (*LLEA* has $f_r$ = 0, which results in a division by 0 when 
calculating OvE). 


## Global clustering results

In our data we had only one pair of globally similar CDR3 sequences, i.e.
the CDR3 sequences *CAS**S**PLEARGYTF* and *CAS**R**PLEARGYTF* which differ 
by one amino acid at position 4. `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` has identified this:

```{r}
# display globally similar pairs
knitr::kable(get_clustirr_clust(o)$CDR3b$global, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Putting it all together $\rightarrow$ graph

To interpret the `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` output we can inspect the tables 
of locally/globally similar CDR3s. Furthermore, we provide the functions 
`get_graph`, which generates an undirected graph (`r CRANpkg("igraph")` 
object), and `plot_graph` for visualization of the graph.

Each vertex in the graph is a T-cell clone (row in the input data.frame for 
repertoire `s`), and we draw an edge between two vertices if they are 
globally similar or if they share an enriched motif (locally similar).
Multiple edges for global and local similarity between two vertices are 
possible.

Let's visualize the graph output for this case study:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
par(mai = c(0,0,0,0))
g <- get_graph(clust_irr = o, edit_dist = 0)
```


```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
plot_graph(g = g)
```

&nbsp;

### Vertices

The graph shows a cluster of T-cell clones (densely connected vertices). 
These are the 20 clones with CDR3 sequences in which we inserted the motif 
*LEAR*. All clones that have an enriched motif are connected in the graph, 
i.e. enriched motifs give rise to cliques. The remaining clones (about 480)
are shown as singleton vertices.

We also see two vertices that are connected by an edge. 
These are the two clones that are globally similar.

We can plot an **interactive** graph with `r CRANpkg("visNetwork")`. Hover or 
click on vertices to see their respective CDR3 sequences. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
vis_g <- plot_graph(g = g, as_visnet = TRUE)
vis_g
```

You can modify the default ClustIRR behavior and show any other vertex 
attribute in the tooltips. In the next code block we set the tooltip as
the concatenation of the CDR3 sequence and the clone size:

```{r}
vis_g$x$nodes$title <- paste0(vis_g$x$nodes$CDR3b, 
                              ' (', vis_g$x$nodes$clone_size, ')')
vis_g
```


Finally, the user might be interested in focusing on only the large connected 
vertices in the graph. You can accomplish this by setting the input parameter 
*show_singletons=FALSE*. This function will only remove vertices with 
vertex degree = 0 (isolated vertices) and clone_size = 1.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
plot_graph(g = g, as_visnet = TRUE, show_singletons = FALSE)
```

### Edges
Between a pair of vertices, we draw an edge if: a) they are globally similar; 
or b) they share an enriched motif. We can have multiple edges between a pair
of vertices (clones) **for each chain**: local, global, local and global.


# Case study 2: analysis of TCR repertoire with large expanded clone

In this case study, we assume that the data contains a clone with 10 
T-cells ($\approx$ 2% of the size of the initial repertoire). All T-cells 
in the expanded clone have the same CDR3b sequence *CATSRPDGLAQYF*. 
`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` should detect most motifs at the core of 
*CATSRPDGLAQYF* as enriched while also reporting that all cells within 
`s` have globally similar (in fact identical) CDR3b sequences.

Let's insert a clone in data set `s`:

```{r}
# create a clone of 10 T-cells
clone <- data.frame(CDR3b = "CATSRPDGLAQYF", clone_size = 10)

# append the clone to the original repertoire 's'
s <- rbind(s, clone)
```

... and once again perform clustering with `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`:

```{r}
o <- cluster_irr(s = s,
                 r = r,
                 ks = 4,
                 cores = 1,
                 control = list(global_smart = FALSE,
                                trim_flank_aa = 3))
```

## Local clustering results
`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` once again reports enrichment of *LEAR*, but also of 
many additional motifs that are part of the core of *CATSRPDGLAQYF*, such as 
*DGLA*, *PDGL*, *RPDG*, *SRPG*, etc.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# extract local motifs
local_motifs <- get_clustirr_clust(o)$CDR3b$local$m

# display only passed motifs
knitr::kable(local_motifs[local_motifs$pass == TRUE, ], row.names = FALSE)
```

## Global clustering results

Once again, `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` finds the same pair of globally similar 
CDR3 sequences. The CDR3 sequences *CAS**S**PLEARGYTF* and *CAS**R**PLEARGYTF* 
differ by one amino acid at position 4.

Let's check how the global and local similarities are represented in the
graph (see next section). Can you find the vertex that corresponds to the 
expanded clone?


## Graph output

Let's plot the clustering results:

```{r}
g <- get_graph(clust_irr = o)
plot_graph(g = g, as_visnet = TRUE)
```

&nbsp;

We see one connected component, which is identical to the one we saw in 
case study 1. Furthermore, we see a large vertex. This represents the 
clonal expansion, where the size of the vertex scales as the logarithm 
of the number of T-cells in the clone.

Clonally expanded cells are globally similar to each other. If the specific 
clonal expansion is only found in `s` but not in `r`, then it is likely that
we will also see an enrichment of certain motifs from the core of the 
corresponding CDR3 sequences. In summary, CDR3s of expanded clones are similar 
in terms of the global sequences but may also be locally similar.


# Case study 3: analysis of TCR repertoire with paired $\alpha\beta$ TCR chains

Single-cell technology allows us to sequence entire TCR repertoires, and
to extract the sequences of both TCR chains: $\beta$ and $\alpha$.

`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` can analyze such data. Clustering is performed 
separately using the CDR3 sequences of each chain.

Let's create the input data. We create two repertoires: 

  * repertoire `S0`: 100 CDR3$\beta$ and CDR3$\alpha$ sequence pairs. 
  * repertoire `S1`: 1,000 CDR3$\beta$ and CDR3$\alpha$ sequence pairs. 
  
Imagine that `S0` and `S1` are two TCR repertoires of a cancer patient, 
sequenced before and after cancer therapy, respectively.

```{r}
data("CDR3ab")

S0 <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[3001:3100],
                 CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[3001:3100],
                 clone_size = c(50, 10, rep(1, times = 98)))

S1 <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[5001:5200],
                 CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[5001:5200],
                 clone_size = c(20, rep(1, times = 199)))

# create a clone of 15 T-cells
clone <- data.frame(CDR3a = "CASSQPGTDHGYTF",
                    CDR3b = "CASSPQGREATGELFF", 
                    clone_size = 15)

# append the clone to the original repertoire 'S0'
S0 <- rbind(S0, clone)

# insert motif LEAR into S0
substr(x = S0$CDR3b[1:20], start = 6, stop = 9) <- "LEAR"

# insert motif WWWW  into S1
substr(x = S1$CDR3b[1], start = 5, stop = 8) <- "WWWW"
```

TCR repertoire `S0` has 

  * two enriched motifs: *LEAR* and *LLEA*
  * two expanded clones:
      * clone `S0-1`: 50 T-cells (CDR3a: CASSFGPYGSQPQHF, CDR3b: CASSRDAGNTIYF)
      * clone `S0-2`: 15 T-cells (CDR3a: CASSQPGTDHGYTF, CDR3b: 
      CASSPQGREATGELFF)
      * clone `S0-3`: 10 T-cells (CDR3a: CATSRLRQGLNEKLFF, CDR3b: CASGGGLAYEQYF)

TCR repertoire `S1` has 

  * one enriched motif: *WWWW*
  * one expanded clone: 
      * clone `S1-1`: 20 T-cells (CDR3a: CASSQPGTDHGYTF, CDR3b: 
      CASSPQGREATGELFF)



We will perform two sets of analysis with `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`.

First, we will inspect how the specificity structure of repertoire `S1` 
(`s`=`S1`) is modulated compare to repertoire `S0` (`r`=`S0`).

```{r}
clust_irrs <- vector(mode = "list", length = 2)
names(clust_irrs) <- c("S1", "S0")

clust_irrs[[1]] <- cluster_irr(s = S1, r = S0,
                               control = list(global_smart = FALSE,
                                              trim_flank_aa = 3))
```

Second, we will do the reverse, i.e. we will inspect the specificity structure
of repertoire `S0` (`s`=`S0`) compared to `S1` (`r`=`S1`).

```{r}
clust_irrs[[2]] <- cluster_irr(s = S0, r = S1,
                               control = list(global_smart = FALSE,
                                              trim_flank_aa = 3))
```

Let's plot the joint graph:

```{r}
# beta & alpha chain
o <- get_joint_graph(clust_irrs = clust_irrs)
```

&nbsp;


```{r}
o$clones[1:5,]
o$clones[1,]
```


## How to interpret the joint graph?

The clones of repertoire `S0` and `S1` are shown as red and yellow 
vertices, respectively. 

Repertoire `S0` contains three expanded clones. Hence, we see three large 
red vertices. Repertoire `S1` contains only one expanded clone shown as 
a large yellow vertex. The remaining vertices are small and likely contain a 
single T-cell.

Within each repertoire, the edges are drawn as explained earlier. 

Meanwhile, in the joint graph we also have edges between the vertices from 
both repertoires. These will be drawn, if a pair of clones in `S0` and `S1` 
have globally similar or equal CDR3 sequences. In this particular example, the
vertices that represents the expanded clones `S0-2` and  `S1-1` (large red 
and yellow vertices) are connected by such an edge.



# Case study 4: analysis of TCR repertoires with paired $\gamma\delta$ chains

`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` can be employed to study the specificity structure of:

  * $\alpha\beta$ chain TCR repertoires
  * $\gamma\delta$ chain TCR repertoires
  * heavy(H)/light(L) chain BCR repertoires

To carry out this analysis, the user must appropriately configure the 
inputs. Here we demonstrate this point. The rest of the clustering analysis 
proceeds similarly as outlined in case studies 1-3.

## Configuring the input
To analyze $\alpha\beta$ chain TCR repertoires, the input data sets `s` and `r`
are required to have one or both (e.g., if we have paired data as explained in
case study 3) of the columns: `CDR3a` and `CDR3b`.

For the analysis of $\gamma\delta$ chain TCR repertoires the columns `CDR3g` 
and `CDR3d` have to be specified. For the analysis of heavy(H)/light(L) 
chain BCR repertoires `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` uses the two columns CDR3h and 
CDR3l.


Dummy example, where we take the `CDR3ab` data set as input and simply rename 
the columns:

```{r, eval=F}
data("CDR3ab")

# gamma/delta chain TCR data -> notice CDR3g and CDR3d columns of 's' and 'r'
s <- data.frame(CDR3g = CDR3ab$CDR3a[4501:5000],
                      CDR3d = CDR3ab$CDR3b[4501:5000])

r <- data.frame(CDR3g = CDR3ab$CDR3a[5001:10000],
                      CDR3d = CDR3ab$CDR3b[5001:10000])

```

```{r, eval=F}
data("CDR3ab")

# heavy/light chain BCR data -> notice CDR3h and CDR3l columns of 's' and 'r'
s <- data.frame(CDR3h = CDR3ab$CDR3a[4501:5000],
                      CDR3l = CDR3ab$CDR3b[4501:5000])

r <- data.frame(CDR3h = CDR3ab$CDR3a[5001:10000],
                      CDR3l = CDR3ab$CDR3b[5001:10000])

```

The rest of the analysis proceeds as usual, i.e., by calling the function
`cluster_irr`.


# Case study 5: joint analysis of 4 TCR repertoires

Imagine that we have a two patients, P1 and P2. From each patient 
we have two IRRs, one before (A) and one after (B) treatment. 

```{r}
data("CDR3ab")

P1_A <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[3001:3100],
                   CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[3001:3100],
                   clone_size = rpois(n = 100, lambda = 1)+1)

P1_B <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[c(3100, 3101:3200)],
                   CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[c(3100, 3101:3200)],
                   clone_size = rpois(n = 101, lambda = 1)+1)

# clone_size column -> poisson distributed
```

```{r}
P2_A <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[c(3100, 4001:4100)],
                   CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[c(3100, 4001:4100)])

P2_B <- data.frame(CDR3a = CDR3ab$CDR3a[c(3100, 4001:4100)],
                   CDR3b = CDR3ab$CDR3b[c(3100, 4001:4100)])

# no clone_size column -> default clone_size = 1
```

We can analyze the specificity structure of IRR A and B by performing 
clustering with `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")`. Here we perform two analyses: 
A vs B and B vs. A, which allows us to find enriched motifs from either
direction. The results are stored in a list of size 4. When `r` is set to 
`NULL`, only global clustering is performed.

```{r}

`r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` provides the unique opportunity to merge the four 
graphs (in fact: as many `r Biocpkg("ClustIRR")` outputs as we want) and 
to visualize them.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# beta & alpha chain
g <- get_joint_graph(clust_irrs = clust_irrs, cores = 1)
```

## How to interpret the joint graph?

Clones are color-coded according to the four input repertoires:

* `P1_A` = red
* `P1_B` = yellow
* `P2_A` = green
* `P2_B` = blue

The clones present in both samples from the same patient are shown as connected 
vertices. 

Clones with larger clone size appear as bigger vertices than clones 
with smaller clone size.

Similarities between clones from different repertoires are drawn as edges 
between different colored vertices. In this case, we can see many connections 
between clones from `P2_A` and `P2_B`, and only one connection `P1_A` and 
`P1_B`, which also connects to clones from `P2_A` and `P2_B`.

Within each repertoire, edges are drawn as explained earlier (not the case 
in this particular graph).

           as_visnet = TRUE, 
           node_opacity = 0.5)

                                trim_flank_aa = 3))
g <- get_graph(clust_irr = o)
plot_graph(g, as_visnet = TRUE)
